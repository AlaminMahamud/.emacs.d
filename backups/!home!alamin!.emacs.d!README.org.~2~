* Why Emacs?
Cause great programmers use Emacs. Thanks for [[tuhdo.github.io][tuhdo's]] excellent guides Many of the resources has taken from his guide.

Editing a 39MB C Source file with no problem. But well, it's not  your favourite editor's fault, if it crashes from editing such a large source file.
